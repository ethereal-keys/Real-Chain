# Blockchain Product Authentication System

## 📋 Overview

A blockchain-based product authentication system that enables manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and consumers to verify product authenticity through QR code scanning. Each product has a unique ID tracked on-chain, ensuring transparency and preventing counterfeiting.

### Key Features
- **QR Code Scanning**: Simple product verification (NFC chip support planned)
- **Blockchain Verification**: Immutable transaction history on-chain
- **Supply Chain Tracking**: Complete journey from manufacture to sale
- **Instant Authentication**: Real-time authenticity verification for consumers

## 🔗 On-Chain Data Structure

Data stored directly on the blockchain for each product:

```solidity
// Core Identity (32 bytes)
uint256 productId;                  // Unique identifier matching QR code

// Ownership & Status (21 bytes)
address currentOwner;                // Current holder (factory/distributor/retailer/0x0 if sold)
uint8 status;                        // 0=MANUFACTURED, 1=QC_PASSED, 2=IN_TRANSIT_DIST, etc.

// Timestamps (16 bytes)
uint32 manufactureDate;              // Unix timestamp when created
uint32 lastTransferDate;             // Unix timestamp of last ownership change
uint32 saleDate;                     // Unix timestamp when sold (0 if not sold)
uint32 recallDate;                   // Unix timestamp if recalled (0 if not recalled)

// Supply Chain Tracking (42 bytes)
address manufacturer;                 // Factory that created product
address distributor;                  // Distributor that handled product (or 0x0)
uint16 factoryId;                    // Which factory location (1, 2, 3, etc.)

// Off-chain Data Pointers (64 bytes)
bytes32 metadataHash;                // IPFS hash for product details
bytes32 certificateHash;             // IPFS hash for certificates/test results

// Verification Data (33 bytes)
bytes32 productTypeHash;             // Hash of SKU/product type for categorization
bool isAuthentic;                    // Can be marked false if found counterfeit

// Metrics (8 bytes)
uint32 scanCount;                    // Number of times QR code scanned
uint32 transferCount;                // Number of times ownership changed
```

## 💾 Off-Chain Data Structure

Data stored in IPFS for cost efficiency:

```
Product ID #12345:
├── Name: "Mickey Mouse Holiday Plush"
├── Serial Number: "DIS-PLUSH-2024-001"
├── Price: $29.99
├── Images: [front.jpg, back.jpg, tag.jpg]
└── Customer: Optional warranty data

## 🔄 Blockchain Transaction Flow

### 1. **Product Manufactured**
- **Action**: Factory scans new product off production line
- **Smart Contract**: `mintProduct(12345)`
- **State Update**: Status = `MANUFACTURED`, Owner = `Factory`

### 2. **Quality Control Passed**
- **Action**: QC Inspector scans and approves product
- **Smart Contract**: `markQualityPassed(12345)`
- **State Update**: Status = `QUALITY_CHECKED`, Owner = `Factory`

### 3. **Shipped to Distributor**
- **Action**: Factory ships pallet of products
- **Smart Contract**: `batchTransferToDistributor([12345...12845])`
- **State Update**: Status = `IN_TRANSIT_TO_DISTRIBUTOR`, Owner = `Distributor`

### 4. **Received at Retail Store**
- **Action**: Retailer receives and stocks product
- **Smart Contract**: `receiveInventory([12345...12394])`
- **State Update**: Status = `IN_STORE`, Owner = `Specific Retailer`

### 5. **Sold to Customer (Point of Sale)**
- **Action**: Customer purchases at checkout
- **Smart Contract**: `markAsSold(12345)`
- **State Update**: Status = `SOLD`, Owner = `#Receipt-ID`

### 6. **Customer Verification**
- **Action**: Customer scans QR code anytime
- **Smart Contract**: `verifyAuthenticity(12345)` [Read-only]
- **Returns**: Authenticity status + Complete history if authentic

## 🔍 User Verification Query Flow

```
1. USER SCANS QR
   ↓ (QR contains: verify.disney.com/p/12345)
   
2. BROWSER OPENS URL
   ↓ (Extracts productId = 12345)
   
3. WEB SERVER QUERIES BLOCKCHAIN
   • Connect to Polygon Network
   • Call: contract.getProductDetails(12345)
   • Receive: {status, owner, ipfsHash, dates}
   
4. VALIDATE ON-CHAIN DATA
   • Check product exists
   • Check not recalled/defective
   • Verify authorized manufacturer
   
5. FETCH OFF-CHAIN DATA (Parallel)
   • Query IPFS for metadata
   • Get product images
   
6. QUERY HISTORY (If needed)
   • Call: contract.queryFilter(events)
   • Build timeline
   
7. DISPLAY RESULT
   • If authentic: Show green checkmark + details
   • If not: Show warning + next steps
```
